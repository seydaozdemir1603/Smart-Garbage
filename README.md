# Smart-Garbage
Thesis Project

Although Smart Garbage may seem like an ordinary project, we are going to build a intelligent garbage bin and develop a mobile application as an IoT project that provides management of the waste in houses, offices or public areas while offers a touchless and effective interaction with user. As in December 2020, we have been in the pandemic for about a year and we, people, are stuck in our homes. We were afraid to go out and touch somewhere. Since we are at home, it should be known that more attention should be paid to cleaning. In this case, we realized that environmental awareness should be increased, and this is important for human health. In this project, we will offer you various solutions to provide that.
